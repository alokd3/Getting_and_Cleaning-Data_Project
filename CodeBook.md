# Purpose #
This Code Book is for the output generated by the run_analysis.R script contained within this repository.

The dataset used by this script is described in the README.md alongside this file, and further information about the dataset can be found in the dataset itself. No detailed information regarding that dataset will be provided here, as the information is best explained by the source.

The original dataset can be found here.

Here are the data for the project:

# The Data #
The original dataset contains training, and experiment data generated by an accelerometer for the purpose of activity detection in a machine learning application. This script will load both the experimental data (referred to as test), as well as the training data (referred to as training). Both training and test data is then merged together to form one dataset.

The combined dataset contains various accelerometer based variables, as well as variables estimated by the original measured variables. These estimated variables include both standard deviations, and medians of some or all of the measured variables.

This script extracts those standard deviation, and mean variables from the combined dataset. After extracting those variables the script then calculates the mean of each of these variables for each activity performed by each subject.

The generated output (default: tidy_mean.csv) is the result of this mean calculation.



# Variables #
Below are the columns found in the output of this script, and their meaning.
• Subject - ID of the subject for this activity
• Activity - Label of the activity generated by the subject

The following variables are the mean, of the variables from the original dataset for the given subject/activity pair with the same name.
